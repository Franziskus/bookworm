This Application is a prove of concept for to use Tika document processing to index documents. This is a working prototype.

The code needs to be cleaned, commented and restructured!
This is an alpha and not for production use!

I use Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers with an
* Apache Tomcat/8.0.24
* apache-maven-3.5.3
* ImageMagick-7.0.8-Q16
* tesseract v4.0.0-beta.1.20180608 (leptonica-1.76.0 - libgif 5.1.4 : libjpeg 8d (libjpeg-turbo 1.5.3) : libpng 1.6.34 : libtiff 4.0.9 : zlib 1.2.11 : libwebp 0.6.1 : libopenjp2 2.2.0)
* JDK 1.8.0 121

on a Windows 10 mashine.
Please setup your web.xml accordingly.
Also don't forget maven clean and install
Most fun happens on webside.jsp.
Have Fun
